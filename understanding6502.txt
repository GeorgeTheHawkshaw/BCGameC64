---UNDERSTANDING 6502 ASSEMBLY---

Registers:
There are 3 main registers in 6502 assembly

A - Accumulator
X - Index Register X
Y - Index Register Y


Operations work on the contents of the registers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Accumulator:

The accumulator is an 8 bit register that handles arithmetic and logical operations (with the execption of increments and decrements). Contents of the accumulator can be stored and retrieved from memory or from the stack. 



Index Register X:

Index Register X is an 8 bit register that is mostly used to hold countres or offsets for accessing memory. The value of the X register can be loaded and saved in memory and compared with other values held in memory, incremented or decremented. THe X register has a function that can be used to get a copy of the stack pointer or change its value.

Index Register Y:

Index Register Y is the same as Index Register X, but it holds no special functions.


Stacks and the Stack Pointer:

The 6502 Processor has a 256 byte stack located in memory addresses $0100 and $01FF. 
SP, the stack pointer is an 8 bit register that decrements every time a byte is pushed on to the stack and incremented when a byte is popped off from a stack
The stack pointer holds the low 8 bits of the next free location on the stack. You cannot move the location of the stack. 
-->The CPU doesn't will not check for overflow on the stack.

Program Counter:
PC is the program counter. The program counter is a 16 bit register that keeps track of where we are in the program. It will always start at a certain memory location such as $0600. The value of the program counter is modified automatically as instructions are executed. It can also be modified by executing a jump, relative branch or a subroutine call to another memory address or returning from a subroutine or interrupt.

Processor Flags:
Each flag is one bit. Processor flags are set by the processor to give information about the previous instruction.
